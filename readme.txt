## Internal Use Social Media Application ##

The company Groupomania has contracted the creation of a social media application for internal use amongst their employees. 

In an effort to build bridges between departments and people, they would like to launch an app where users can freely share things informally.

This app will mimic either Reddit or 9gag.
The app will allow users to share pictures, gifs, commentary, and their reactions. 


It will be developed using:
MySql
Express
React
Node
